Rules as a Micro Service. 

An AI NLP based, Cloud based modern, state-of-the-art yet simple Rule Engine and Management tool, which serves Business Rules as Micro Services. Rules can be expressed in a natural language format and the engine will translate it into machine executable expressions which can be executed during runtime via serverless functions using different cloud providers like AWS, Azure etc. Takes away many pain points of configuation, storage and execution of rules.


Using .Net Core ( for back-end services ) , Azure, AWS and other modern, cutting-edge technologies to develop this software. We will be soon also be using some NLP SDK to process the Rules expressed in natural language.
Project has just started. Contributors are most welcome.
